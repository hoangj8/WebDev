	<h2> HTML Basics </h2>
	<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. In essence, it is used for "marking up" the information on your webpages: 
	   organizing them into clear sections and categories through the use of <dfn>tags</dfn>; identifiers enclosed between &lt; and &gt;. This allows the computer
	   to "understand" the information on the webpage better for assistive technologies like screen readers. The tags also allow us to directly manipulate
	   specific parts of our web pages with CSS or JS to our liking.
	</p>
	<p>At its absolute basic form, an HTML document will consist of the following tags:
		<figure>
			<code>
			<pre>
			&lt;!doctype html&gt;
			&lt;html&gt;
			
			&lt;head&gt;
				&lt;title&gt;<i>My Page Title</i>&lt;/title&gt;
			&lt;/head&gt;
				
			&lt;body&gt;
				<i>Content goes here</i>
			&lt;/body&gt;

			&lt;/html&gt;
			</pre></code>
			<figcaption>Barebones HTML document skeleton</figcaption>
		</figure>
		The first line looks like a tag but is not a tag at all. It's just a description that tells the computer what the document contains.<br>
		The <code> &lt;html&gt; </code> tag is like the bun of a burger. Everything in the web page must be contained within the <code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code>tags.<br>
		The <code> &lt;head&gt; </code> tag are the condiments of the burger. As shown in the above example, the title of the page is defined here (it's what the browser will use when naming the tab of your webpage). Other things like style changes and metadata are also found within these tags. <br>
		The <code> &lt;body&gt; </code> tag is the patty. All of your content, the stuff that the users will see, goes within the &lt;body&gt; tag.
		The term <dfn> element </dfn> is used to refer to a set of opening and closing tags and their content (if any). All elements are grouped up into two main categories: block elements and inline elements. Block elements take up space on the webpage, with each block element covering a certain area or block. Inline elements are elements which further markup the content within block elements, like quotations or italics. Inline elements don't take up space on their own. Thus, block elements can have nested inline elements but not the other way around.</p>
	<p> Now that we've got the basics down, lets take a look at the rest of the tags which we'll use to mark up our content. 
</section>

<section class="block">
	<H2>Block elements</H2>
	<dl>
		<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
		<dt> <code> &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Content between tags is used to form paragraphs. Each paragraph element always display on new lines. Cannot contain (nest) other block elements</dd>  
		<h3>Headings</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Content between tags is used to form headings. By default, all headings are in bold, with H1 being the largest and most significant all the way to H6 which is the smallest.</dd>
		<h3>Lists</h3>
		<dt><code><pre>
		&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;</pre></code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Creates an unordered list. Each list item must be encapsulated by an &lt;li&gt; tag. By default, each list item is marked by a bulletpoint.</dd>
		<dt><code><pre>
		&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;</pre></code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Creates an ordered list. Each list item must be encapsulated by an &lt;li&gt; tag. Items in ordered lists are marked numerically, starting with 1.</dd>
		<dt><code><pre>
		&lt;dl&gt;
		&lt;dt&gt;...&lt;/dt&gt;
		&lt;dd&gt;...&lt;/dd&gt;
		&lt;/dl&gt;</pre></code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Creates a description list - a list of terms and definitions. Each term must be enclosed by &lt;dt&gt; tags and each definition must be enclosed by &lt;dd&gt; tags. </dd>
		<h3>Quotations</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to distinguish long quoations or testimonials from the rest of the text. By default, content here is placed on a new line and indented. </dd>
		<dt><code>&lt;q&gt;...&lt;/q&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Inline element</i><br>Used for short, single line quotations. By default, quotation marks are automatically added to the content by the browser. Firefox uses curly quotes, while Chrome uses straight quotes.</dd>
		<h3>Preformatted Text</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;pre&gt;..&lt;/pre&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to display any whitespace exactly as it is typed between the tags. Good for displaying code (ex. see HTML skeleton) or for other situations where placement of words is important.</dd>
		<h3>Figures</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;figure&gt;..&lt;/figure&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to label content as supporting information, like tables, images, videos, etc.</dd>
		<dt><code>&lt;figcaption&gt;..&lt;/figcaption&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Normally used above or below a figure element to describe the figure.</dd>
		<h3>Main Content</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;main&gt;..&lt;main&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to help the browser identify the main content of the page; helpful for screen readers and other assistive technolgies.Each page can only have <em>one</em> <code>main</code> tag and it can't be nested in <code>article</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>header</code>,<code>footer</code>, or <code>nav</code> elements.</dd>
		<h3>Headers</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;header&gt;..&lt;/header&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Different from text headers! This is used to label content that is found at the top of a page or section of a page like navigation, site title, logos, or introductions.</dd>
		<h3>Footers</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;footer&gt;..&lt;/footer&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to label content normally found at the bottom like dates, authors, and copyright. If it is placed in the <code>body</code> then it is considered to apply to the entire document. If it is placed within <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>nav</code>, or <code>aside</code>, then it is considered to be part of those sections.</dd>
		<h3>Sections</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;section&gt;...&lt;/section&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to divide long pages into logical and browser identifiable sections. For example, a page about pets could have a section for cats and a section for dogs</dd>
		<h3>Articles</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;article&gt;...&lt;/article&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block elemtn</i><br>Articles are specialized sections containing content that can be considered standalone / can be used outside the scope of its surrounding material.</dd>
		<h3>Aside</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;aside&gt;...&lt;/aside&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to identify content that is related to but not critical to the surrounding information. It could contain a list of links for more information, quotes, background information, etc. There is no default rendering of this element so you'll need to use style sheets to adjust its appearance.</dd>
		<h3>Navigation</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;nav&gt;...&lt;nav&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to identify navigation / links on the page for the web browser. Should only be used for the primary navigation around a site</dd>
		<h3>Addresses</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;address&gt;...&lt;address&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd><i>Block element</i><br>Used to identify addresses for the web browser, usually found at the botttom of the page.</dd>

	<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
	<dl>
		<h3>Emphasized text</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to add emphasis to a part of a sentence. Browsers render this as italicized text but it also has the secondary effect of generating a different tone of voice in screen readers to make the emphasis clear to listeners. If you just want the words italicized for stylistic purposes, it is better to use the <code>&lt;i&gt;...&lt;i&gt;</code> tags or style sheets.</dd> 
		<h3>Important text</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify words or phrases that are important or serious in nature. Browsers render this in bold text and screen readers may change their tone of voice. It you just want the words bolded for stylisitc purposes, it is better to use the <code>&lt;b&gt;...&lt;b&gt;</code> tags or style sheets.</dd>
		<h3>Abbreviations</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;abbr title="..."&gt;...&lt;/abbr&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to markup acronyms and abbreviations for search engines and screen readers. The title attribute provides the long version of the abbreviation for further markup.</dd>
		<h3>Citations</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;cite&gt;...&lt;/cite&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify references to other material like books or articles. The browser renders this content in italics.</dd>
		<h3>Defining terms</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;dfn&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify the first instances of new terms. Browser doesn't have any special renders for them so be sure to do so in CSS.</dd>
		<h3>Code</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify code snippets or references. This content is rendered in monospace font. Combine this with <code>pre</code> to show the code structure </dd>
		<h3>Subscript</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;sub&gt;...&lt;/sub&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Causes the content text to turn into subscript form.</dd>
		<h3>Superscript</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Causes the content text to turn into superscript form.</dd>
		<h3>Highlight text</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;mark&gt;...&lt;/mark&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to highlight parts of the text. This is not rendered in the browser so use style sheets to create visible highlights.</dd>
		<h3>Time</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;time datetime="..."&gt;...&lt;/time&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify parts of the text that refer to time, which can used by search engines or other applications. The datetime attribute is used to convert the time in the content to a machine-readable format. The figure below shows the structure on how to convert times so that they can be understood by the browser.
			<figure>
				<img src="images/datetime_structure.png" alt="time format for datetime attribute">
			</figure>
		</dd>
		<h3>Machine-readable information</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;data value="..."&gt;...&lt;/data&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to provide translations of the content into machine readable form for search engines or other applications. For example, "12" for "twelve" or an ISBN number for a book.</dd>
		<h3>Word breaks</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>This tag is used to tell the browser where to split a word in the event that there isn't enough room. Simply insert this tag at the spots in the word where you'd like a break to be in the even that a break is needed. Can help to keep words from being split in awkward places (ex. in the middle of a syllable).</dd>
		<h3>Generic markup elements</h3>
		<dt><code>&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>A generic block element that can be used to markup areas of the page that don't really go under other categories or just to add more markup more things on the page so that they can be targetted with CSS or JS.</dd>
		<dt><code>&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>Just like a <code>div</code> but for inline elements.</dd>

<section id="globalattributes">
	<h2>Global Attributes</h2>
	<p> There are many global attributes which can be applied to every tag. Here are 4 of the most important ones.</p>
	<dl>
		<h3>Unique identifier</h3>
		<dt><code>id="..."</code></dt>
		<dd>Assigns an id to the element. No two elements can have the same ID. Good for applying style rules or scripts to a single specific area on the webpage.</dd>
		<h3>Classification</h3>
		<dt><code>class="..."</code></dt>
		<dd>Assigns a class to the element. There can be more than one element with the same class. Good for applying the same style rules or scripts to multiple different tags or a specific subgroup of elements with the same tag</dd>
		<h3>Language</h3>
		<dt><code>lang="..."</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify the language used in the tag for the browser.</dd>
		<h3>Roles</h3>
		<dt><code>role="..."</code></dt>
		<dd>Used to identify the function or purpose of the element. Examples: toolbar, alert, button, navigation, info, etc.</dd>
	</dl>

<section id="charescape">
	<h2>Character Escapes</h2>
	<p>In HTML there are certain characters that have special meaning like &lt; and &gt;, which are understood by the browser to form tags. Thus in order to include these (and other special characters) in our content, we need special shortcuts</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Character</th>
			<th>Shortcut</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&lt;</td>
			<td>&amp;lt;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&gt;</td>
			<td>&amp;gt;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&quot;</td>
			<td>&amp;quot;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&apos;</td>
			<td>&amp;apos;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&amp;</td>
			<td>&amp;amp;</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>Some characters are even invisible but have important uses. For example, the non-breaking space <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is used in place of a normal space and prevents breaks happening between the two words is placed at.</p>
	<p>Other characters like &copy; and &trade;  are not even located on the keyboard and thus, special shortcuts are required for them. A complete list of these <dfn>character entitities</dfn> and their shortcuts can be found <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#named-character-references">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="Adding images">
	<h2>Adding Images</h2>
	<p> <code>&lt;img src="..." alt=""&gt;</code></p>
	<p>We add images using the above inline element. The <code>src</code> attribute tells the browser where to find the image (its URL or file location). The <code>alt</code> attribute gives the browser some alternate text to display if the picture doesn't load for some reason. As for the image file itself,  PNG, JPEG, or GIF files work fine right away. Other file types like TIFF and BMP need to be converted to a web format. SVG images are a whole other beast that can be added inline using the <code>img</code>tags above or by writing out all the vector points and putting them between <code>&lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</code> tags. The first option is simple but doesn't let you do anything to the SVG with JS. The second option does but all the vector points can add bloat to your code and the image isn't cached so it needs to be redrawn every time.
	</p>
	<h3>Responsive images</h3>
	<p>There are a couple of ways to make images resize appropriately depending on the screensize of the device the webpage is being viewd on. The first is using the img element with a couple of new attributes: <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code>.</p>
	<figure>
		<code>
		<pre>
			&lt;img src="house.jpg" alt="house"
				srcset="house-240.jpg 240w,
						house-480.jpg 480w,
						house-672.jpg 672w"
				sizes="(max-width:480px) 100vw,
						(max-width: 960px) 70vw,
						240px"&gt;
		</pre>
		</code>
	</figure>
	<p>The <code>sizes</code> attribute tells the browser what size the image should be, depending on the viewport. The media condition, which in this case is viewport width, is enclosed in circle brackets. This is followed by the percentage of the viewport width the image width should take up if that condition is met. In the example above, the first rule states that if the max-width of the viewport is 480 pixels, then the image width should match the viewport width (100%). Multiple rules are separated by commas and their combined effect is like an <code>if-else</code> statement. Back to the example, we can take the entire sizes conditions as having the following effect: If the viewport width is &lt;=480px, then then image width will be 100% of the viewport width. Else if the viewport width is larger than 480px but smaller than 960px, the image should be 70% of the viewport width. Finally in cases where viewport width is more than 960 px, then the image should just be exactly 240px. The <code>srcset</code> attribute provides the set of images, each at different sizes. It is up to the browser however to make the final choice of which size image to pick. However, since we've told it what to expect the image size to be with the <code>sizes</code> attribute, it will be able to select the most appropriate image from the srcset to download.</p>
	<p> The second way to implement responsive images is through the <code>picture</code> tag, as shown below.
	<figure>
		<code>
		<pre>
			&lt;picture&gt;
				&lt;source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="house-large.jpg"&gt;
				&lt;source media="(min-width: 760px)" srcset="house-medium.jpg"&gt;
				&lt;img src="house-small.jpg" alt="house"&gt;
			&lt;/picture&gt;
		</pre>
		</code>
	</figure>
	<p>There are no attributes for the picture element. As for content, it takes a bunch of alternate sources and the conditions where they should be used. So instead of letting the browser pick what it thinks is the best image size, we're telling it which one to pick. The final element in the list of sources must be an <code>img</code> element because that is how the image will be placed onto the page. The <code>img</code> content will be used if none of the source media conditions hold. Use this method for placing a <i>better</i> image for each viewport size as opposed to simply resizing the <i>same</i> image.
	<br> You can test the resizing capabilities with the following pages: <a href="nimg.html" target="_blank">Normal img</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="rimg.html" target="_blank">Responsive img</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="rpicture.html" target="_blank">Responsive Picture</a>
